I tried to validate in other places and it works, because I didn’t change anything other than updating to 0.3.0 of thecentral-publishing-maven-plugin (previous versions receive a 500 error from sonatype)

In my case the problem was that I didn’t upload the gpg public key to server. Check docs
here
The command itself:
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys {INSERT_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE}
But wait a bit, Sonatype has some cache for keys

Hi Oleg Kuzmin,
I also have the same problem and wanted to ask
How much time does it take for Sonatype’s server cache to confirm the GPG key?
Thanks

I got successful publishing after 24 hours after uploading my public key to the server. I think, this moment shouldbe reflected in documentation here.
